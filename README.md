This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This app will show your aproximate location on a map based on your IpAdress.
This is done by calling an external API wich then returns your coordinates. And those coordinates will then be shown in this website's map.

You can look for random coordinates and see where that takes you.
If the coordinates are not valid, or no location was found the map will most likely either:

- - Take you to the middle of nowhere
- - Not make any change to the current location.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
